# Can Seasonality Predict Wildfires in California?



This project investigates how seasonal variation influences wildfire intensity in California from 2013 to 2020. Using OLS regression models and weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed), we analyzed fire extinguish time across 56 counties. Results suggest that both seasonality and its interaction with weather factors significantly impact wildfire behavior, offering insights for future policy and disaster preparedness.
